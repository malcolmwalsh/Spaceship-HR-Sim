# Spaceship-HR-Sim
Spaceship HR Sim is a very simple console game built with C# and Unity.

## Getting Started
Open Unity project and press play.

## Introduction to the game
You have been hired as the head of HR on a small cargo ship that runs between Earth and Mercury delivering sunscreen. The previous crew mutinied and stole all the sunscreen and are now living somewhere on Venus. But that's not your problem. Your problem is that you need to fill out the available crew before you can begin the important missions to Mercury. Your other problem, and it's a substantial one, is that Earth has recently been visited by an alien species capable of taking on the image of a human for a short period of time. Using this skill, these parasites could potentially get hired as a crew member if you're not careful in your vetting process.

You have one advantage over the parasites however. As these aliens are new to Earth they haven't figured out exactly what makes a human a human when it comes to hobbies. These parasites will have read some books certainly, but you feel that by asking them what they enjoy doing in their spare time you may be able to distinguish the parasites from real people. And you should try to do this, or else the parasite will make their way through the ship killing as many humans as they can before escaping into space (they can do this - I probably should have mentioned that earlier).

Keep interviewing recruits until you have hired 10 humans to crew the ship. If you let five or more parasites onto the ship, or let five or more humans die, your contract will be terminated immediately.

Good luck, Head of HR!

## Instructions
All controls use the mouse. 

Click the `Generate Potential Crewmate` button and find out a little about the new recruit. Then decide whether to hire them or not using the `Accept` and `Refuse` buttons.

## Licence
You can play if you want to. You won't for long though. It's pretty dull.
